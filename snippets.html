<h2>
	About
</h2>
<p>
	Born and raised in music, DJ Ipnoz started putting fingers on vinyls by the age of 16 in Canada. He grew up with African and Soul music from around the world before touching to other styles.
	He came to Hip Hop and Dancehall from the 90's listening to radio stations and learning from other cultural atmospheres.
	Tired of being a resident in diverse clubs around France and London, He started being party and event's promoter for his own label with a friend : WE PARTY HARD. Mixing different rhythms all night long by pushing the crowd to their limits is it's main duty as a deejay, as he intend to make people discover its musical universe.
